                    <p>Music has been an integral component of emotional expression and storytelling since the beginning of human culture. How can a structured collection of sounds convey and evoke such deep emotion? Gehirnrauschen is a poetic exploration of the ways in which our brains respond to music and the role of a musical performer.</p>

                    <p>The first track you will hear is a recording of my performance of Lisztâ€™s concert etude Waldesrauschen. Interested in the interaction of my brain with the music, I then recorded a single electrode EEG of myself listening to my own recording.</p>

                    <p>When overlaying my time-synced, sonified brain activity with the original piano music in the third track, some coordinated fluctuations can be found in certain passages, suggesting that certain peaks in the music are correlated with higher brain activation. These periods of higher activation are vague; perhaps the intensity of the music produced feelings of euphoria, or maybe a technically difficult passage induced anxiety and panic. The brain is certainly responding to music, but the subjectivity of the experience remains uncaptured by EEG.</p>

                    <p>Lastly, I composed Gehirnrauschen, incorporating motifs and textures from the sonified EEG data with themes from Waldesrauschen. The piece roughly mirrors certain interesting interactions and shapes from the brain in response to Liszt. </p>

                    <p>The brain is often portrayed as a purely intellectual entity and romanticized to transcend physicalism. The sonification of the physical processes of the brain provides a corporeal portrayal of the brain and its existence as a fleshy organ. I hope that listeners of Gehirnrauschen will begin to introspect on the ways in which music affects them and examine the philosophical contradiction of a physical entity that produces intensely private and ineffable emotions and experiences.</p>
